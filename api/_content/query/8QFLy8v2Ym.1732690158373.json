This is the point we decided that getting some sleep would be a good idea. This is the second thing that will be part of all my future game jams as well."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As we did setup alarms for 9.00am we both woke up the same time and started the second day with a little brainstorming/planing session on what we did and what we want to do on that day. And as I was fully rested I allowed myself another break and went to do some sport and getting a shower (the shower is something that maybe all of us jammers should get while jamming)."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After this longer break we started to code away until dinner time. At this point I already realized that compared to 2018 I felt way more energy and made less mistakes while programming.\nOur break for dinner ended up in just getting some fresh air and ordering sushi afterwards. After our again longer sushi break wie programmed away until we again went to bed at around 2am. Like the morning before we stood up at 9am and started with a short brainstorming session on what we actually want to finish in the last hours."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We agreed on finishing up at 16.00 as we did not want to miss our uploading window. So when we hit the \"build game\" button the first time at 16.10 we both realized that we did not build the game until there. Luckily it worked and we could fix some stuff until we finally uploaded our game at 16.55 with 5 minutes left on the clock."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"learnings"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Learnings"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I think, the thing that will stay in my head the most is that you should "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sleep"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

The only goal of the jam should be having fun, meeting people and try stuff."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Also you should not focus on things that only create trouble in the beginning, I got stuck on a simple import of an model at the beginning of the jam. This nearly killed all my motivation and frustrated me like hell. I did not need that import on that point, I could've just moved on but I did not, the next time I'll hopefully remember this and just go on with the stuff I planed to do."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And lastly, even if the jam is only 48h like the GGJ, do some sort of project planing and talk with your team mates. Do short breaks for planing and updating each other how far you've come and where you could need help. Also do not hesitate on cutting back features when you realize that you can not finish them in time."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"timeline"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Timeline"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"day-01"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Day 01"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"17:00"}]},{"type":"text","value":" -
