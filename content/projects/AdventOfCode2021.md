Solution for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles written in TypeScript using [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)

Visualization of times and scores in the company internal leaderboard is based on the [Advent of Code Dashboard](https://github.com/EldoranDev/AdventOfCodeDashboard) project that I created for the year.
