Since the release of [Matt Parkers Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlpIojusBE) it became a tradition for me, that at some point in November I start tinkering
with my overly overegineered fairy lights of my christmas tree. Like the lights from the inspiring video, I am using ws2811 LED's that are controlled by a raspberry pi.

This year two additions where made to the existing infrastructure:

1. Moving away from a custom user interface in favor of HomeAssistant integration
2. Adding a Lego ToyPad as physical interface
